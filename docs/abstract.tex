\subsection*{Abstract}
Mobile applications are often integrated with third-party components that support particular functionalities such as providing advertising, analytics, or authenticating users (e.g., Facebook Login). Although third-party components aid convenience in app development, the host applications can be exposed to security vulnerabilities if these components already have the vulnerabilities or the integration process is prone to introducing new vulnerabilities. Once such vulnerability is discovered, a critical next step is to examine potentially a large number existing applications that include the responsible third-party component to identify vulnerable copies that have been already circulated through application market places. This paper presents challenges and our approaches to developing a tool that automates the execution of security test cases across a large number of Android applications. Our tool development is driven by a recently discovered vulnerability associated with the use of Facebook SDK for Android [XXX]. The tool, sMonkey, embodies the efficient GUI navigation methods that we developed based on insights from static analysis of XXX Android applications. We evaluate sMonkey against XXX Android apps that contain Facebook SDK. We find that XXX\% of examined apps are vulnerable. Compared with the random GUI testing approach, sMoneky reduces the number of GUI elements to click through by XXX\% and improves the test coverage by XXX\%. We present ways that this tool can be extended to support other potentially interesting security and privacy test cases for mobile applications.~\cite{monkey}
