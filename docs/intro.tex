\chapter{Introduction}
SmartMonkey is a record and replay tool for android. Built on top of UIAutomator~\cite{uiautomator}, SmartMonkey allows the user to interact with either an emulator or a real Android device, and record the trace of the sequence of events to a file. This file can then be used to replay the same set of events back onto the device/emulator. The tool can be useful for finding security vulnerabilities, finding bugs, and several other uses discussed by Flinn \etal~\cite{Flinn:2011:DRE:2184489.2184507}
